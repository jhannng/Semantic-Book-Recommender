# Semantic Book Recommender with LLMs

## Description

> The **Semantic Book Recommender** is an AI-powered system that assists users discover books based on natural language queries. It leverages **Google Gemini LLM**, **semantic search**, and **zero-shot classification** to provide context-aware recommendations.

## Features

   Powered by embeddings stored in a **vector database**.

2. **Zero-Shot Classification**  
   Classify books as **fiction** or **non-fiction**, enabling facet-based filtering.

3. **Sentiment & Emotion Analysis**  
   Extracts emotional tones from book descriptions and user reviews (e.g., suspenseful, joyful, sad).  
   Allows sorting/filtering by tone or emotional impact.
